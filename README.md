I'm working on a demo React project where I'm applying my skills in data fetching from a REST API, using states, effects, memos, refs, custom hooks, saving data to local storage, and building a single-page app with pure CSS. My next goals are to add React Testing Library and expand the project with additional pages using React Router.
